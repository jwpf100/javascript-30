    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    team[3] = 'Luz';  //team is just a reference to the original array, so when players get edited, team points at that.

    console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3] ='Joseph';
    console.log(team2, players)


    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = 'Nikki'
    console.log(team3, team2, players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Lyra'
    console.log(team4, team3, team2, players);

    //OR

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'Antonio';
    console.log(team5, team4, team3, team2, players)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    console.log(captain, person)
    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 25 });
    captain2.number = 130;

    console.log(captain2, captain, person)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    const captain3 = {...person};

    captain3.number = 999;
    captain3.age = 69;

    console.log(captain3, captain2, captain, person)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      name: 'Joe',
      age: 37,
      social: {

      }
    }

    console.log(Joe)

    const dev = Object.assign({}, Joe)

    //Shallow so is a referecnce to deeper levels i.e. will change the original as well.

    //This is not a good way to clone an object but it does work.
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(Joe));
